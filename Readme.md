# Git Training Wheels

## Description

If you're anything like me, you learned the basics of git quickly for a job or a project but never learned to use it effectively.

That's why I created Git Training Wheels. The project is exactly what it sounds like. The binary `wheels` wraps git commands and
prevents you from making stupid mistakes.
